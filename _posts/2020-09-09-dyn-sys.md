The course "Dynamical Systems & Chaos" was implemented in the spring semester of 2014 and 2016.
I interact with students in accordance with the culture, student habits, and 
demands for learning outcomes. Here, I show a typical web-site for the course I teach.
This demonstrates the outline of the course, materials needed for studying and passing the exam,
student projects and homeworks. 
I hope this demo gives an idea for my communication with the students.

Additionally, for this course I recorded video lectures to facilitate learning, see the
video demo [here]({% post_url 2020-08-08-video-lecture %}).
