I participated in Physics Department's activities to attract more
freshman students into Physics. At the time, the task was to determine
healthy heart beating by just looking at the time series of inter-beat
intervals and animation of the heart that beats according to the real
data. Some other activities that change the heart rate were also part
of the teaser. Subsequently, I personally supervised a junior in this
topic.
