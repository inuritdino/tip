According to my teaching philosophy I try to meet students' needs in the learning process.
Thus, for example, I compiled all my lectures into a series of video clips to facilitate
learning: some students are more comfortable in a class, yet others are better
in learning from their comfort zones.
This way, I believe students can learn more effectively 
accommodating the learning process to their needs and achieve the learning outcomes better.

In 2014 I recorded all lectures for the course Dynamical Systems and Chaos and
gave the students the options to learn.
