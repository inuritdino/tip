I sometimes give students options for learning. These usually include class-based lectures
and home-based video lectures. This way, I believe students can learn more effectively 
accommodating the learning process to their needs and achieve the learning outcomes better.

For example, in 2014 I recorded all lectures for the course Dynamical Systems and Chaos and
gave the students the above options of learning.
