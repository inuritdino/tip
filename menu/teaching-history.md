I started teaching at the university level early on during my PhD studies at Tampere University of
Technology. Almost every post-doctoral term included teaching among my responsibilities. Here, I
tried to summarize different topics and courses I have taught so far.


## Mathematical Modelling of Cellular Systems, 2011-2012
I taught in two rounds of implementation in 2011 and 2012. The course included both
lectures and seminars. Tampere University of Technology, Signal Processing Dep.

Topics: Deterministic & Stochastic Models, Chemical Kinetics, 
Chemical Master Equation, Monte-Carlo Simulations for Chemical
Kinetics, Mathematical Models of Neurons and Gene Regulatory Networks.

Audience: graduate and doctoral students


## Dynamical Systems and Chaos, 2014-2016

I taught in two implementations. The course included theoretical aspects in part I and
Biological Applications in part II. Tampere University of Technology, Mathematics Dep.

Topics: Differential Equations, Linear vs. Nonlinear Systems, Stability analysis,
Bifurcation Analysis.

Audience: graduate and advanced undergraduate students


## Advanced Systems Biology, 2019-2020

I taught two implementations. This course is a specialized course for Master students
in Systems Biology. University of Luxembourg, Luxembourg Centre for Systems Biomedicine.

Topics: Networks in Biology, (Probabilistic) Boolean Networks, Stochastic Modeling

Audience: graduate students, specialization in Systems Biology


## Graph Theory, 2020

I helped teaching this course for junior students.

Topics: Graphs, Networks, Network Centrality Measures, Applications in Biology,
Practical Exercises.

Audience: undergraduate students.
